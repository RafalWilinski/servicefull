I'm seeing an interesting juxtaposition lately. While many people claim we're seeing a [downfall of the software quality and speed](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/), it is also a well known fact that optimizing your website speed is crucial for your business' success. Just a second of delay [affects user engagement](https://blog.pusher.com/how-latency-affects-user-engagement/) and lowers your business KPIs significantly. There's a big contrast between what's delivered and what's expected. 

We are trying to bridge this gap by ~~throwing money~~ using solutions like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) or [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/), which deploy our websites to the globally available CDNs to fix the latency problem, but often times speed of these websites is limited by the slowness of related APIs or specifically, how far our requests have to travel through the internet to reach the public endpoint. Paradigms like [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/), which try to eliminate the need of interacting with APIs, are definitely step in a right direction. However, they are not a remedy. Some use cases just [won't fit that model](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/the-issues-with-jamstack-you-might-need-a-backend-d101791de36a), you might still need a classical backend.

I wanted to explore that problem and see if I can reduce the latency between the end user and API by deploying a Serverless GraphQL _"server"_ to the each of the [CloudFront CDN edge locations](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/) using [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) and make that work with [globally replicated DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/) table.

Here's how I imagined it:

![GraphQL@Edge infrastructure](./overview.png 'Overview')

Essentially, each user around the globe instead of hitting that one central endpoint in `us-east-1` would be routed to the one of the closest GraphQL _"servers"_ and that _"server"_ would fetch the data from closest globally replicated DynamoDB table using optimized route.

Since I'm not a big fan of AWS Console, [just like many people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20901800), I decided to take use of AWS' new way of provisioning infrastructure, the [Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). 

With CDK, provisioning something which might seem really complicated like this example, can actually be done with less than 100 lines of code. Here's the complete infrastructure code proof of concept explained step by step:

<br/>

<CodeWave>

```ts
export class GraphQLAtEdge extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const table = new Table(this, 'globdynamodb', {
      partitionKey: { name: 'hashKey', type: AttributeType.STRING },
      replicationRegions,
    });
  }
}
```

First, we provision a DynamoDB table with `replicationRegions` parameter. This creates a multi-master NoSQL database with replicas located in desired regions. For the sake of example, I will be using table with simple `string` partition key called just `hashKey`.

```ts
export class GraphQLAtEdge extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const table = new Table(this, 'globdynamodb', {
      partitionKey: { name: 'hashKey', type: AttributeType.STRING },
      replicationRegions,
    });

    const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: 'playground.html',
    });
  }
}
```

Then, provision an S3 bucket which will be an origin for CloudFront distribution and will host [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground), a web-IDE which makes interaction with GraphQL APIs much easier.

```jsx
export class GraphQLAtEdge extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const table = new Table(this, 'globdynamodb', {
      partitionKey: { name: 'hashKey', type: AttributeType.STRING },
      replicationRegions,
    });

    const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: 'playground.html',
    });

    const graphql = new NodejsFunction(this, 'lambda', {
      entry: './src/graphql-server/dist/function.js',
      handler: 'handler',
      memorySize: 128, // Max
      minify: true, // To fit below 1MB code limit
      timeout: Duration.millis(5000), // Max
      role: new Role(this, 'AllowLambdaServiceToAssumeRole', {
        assumedBy: new CompositePrincipal(
          new ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),
          new ServicePrincipal('edgelambda.amazonaws.com')
        ),
        managedPolicies: [
          ManagedPolicy.fromManagedPolicyArn(
            this,
            'gql-server-managed-policy',
            'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'
          ),
        ],
      }),
    });
  }
}
```

Next, add a Serverless function with [maximum limits](https://twitter.com/AwsTricks/status/1261950071760916486) for a Lambda@Edge with `VIEWER_REQUEST` type. Code for this Lambda will be stored inside [/src/graphql-server/]() directory. We also attach a [standard managed IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html) which allows uploading logs to CloudWatch.

```jsx
export class GraphQLAtEdge extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const table = new Table(this, 'globdynamodb', {
      partitionKey: { name: 'hashKey', type: AttributeType.STRING },
      replicationRegions,
    });

    const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: 'playground.html',
    });

    const graphql = new NodejsFunction(this, 'lambda', {
      entry: './src/graphql-server/dist/function.js',
      handler: 'handler',
      memorySize: 128, // Max
      minify: true, // To fit below 1MB code limit
      timeout: Duration.millis(5000), // Max
      role: new Role(this, 'AllowLambdaServiceToAssumeRole', {
        assumedBy: new CompositePrincipal(
          new ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),
          new ServicePrincipal('edgelambda.amazonaws.com')
        ),
        managedPolicies: [
          ManagedPolicy.fromManagedPolicyArn(
            this,
            'gql-server-managed-policy',
            'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'
          ),
        ],
      }),
    });

    table.grantFullAccess(graphql);
  }
}
```

We also grant full access to the table created in step 1.

```jsx
export class GraphQLAtEdge extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const table = new Table(this, 'globdynamodb', {
      partitionKey: { name: 'hashKey', type: AttributeType.STRING },
      replicationRegions,
    });

    const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: 'playground.html',
    });

    const graphql = new NodejsFunction(this, 'lambda', {
      entry: './src/graphql-server/dist/function.js',
      handler: 'handler',
      memorySize: 128, // Max
      minify: true, // To fit below 1MB code limit
      timeout: Duration.millis(5000), // Max
      role: new Role(this, 'AllowLambdaServiceToAssumeRole', {
        assumedBy: new CompositePrincipal(
          new ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),
          new ServicePrincipal('edgelambda.amazonaws.com')
        ),
        managedPolicies: [
          ManagedPolicy.fromManagedPolicyArn(
            this,
            'gql-server-managed-policy',
            'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'
          ),
        ],
      }),
    });

    table.grantFullAccess(graphql);

    const graphqlVersion = graphql.addVersion(
      ':sha256:' + sha256('./src/graphql-server/function.ts')
    );
  }
}
```


To make deploying faster, we're deploying the function only if `sha256` of the code has changed.

```jsx
export class GraphQLAtEdge extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const table = new Table(this, 'globdynamodb', {
      partitionKey: { name: 'hashKey', type: AttributeType.STRING },
      replicationRegions,
    });

    const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'bucket', {
      publicReadAccess: true,
      websiteIndexDocument: 'playground.html',
    });

    const graphql = new NodejsFunction(this, 'lambda', {
      entry: './src/graphql-server/dist/function.js',
      handler: 'handler',
      memorySize: 128, // Max
      minify: true, // To fit below 1MB code limit
      timeout: Duration.millis(5000), // Max
      role: new Role(this, 'AllowLambdaServiceToAssumeRole', {
        assumedBy: new CompositePrincipal(
          new ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),
          new ServicePrincipal('edgelambda.amazonaws.com')
        ),
        managedPolicies: [
          ManagedPolicy.fromManagedPolicyArn(
            this,
            'gql-server-managed-policy',
            'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole'
          ),
        ],
      }),
    });

    table.grantFullAccess(graphql);

    const graphqlVersion = graphql.addVersion(
      ':sha256:' + sha256('./src/graphql-server/function.ts')
    );

    const distribution = new CloudFrontWebDistribution(this, 'MyDistribution', {
      originConfigs: [
        {
          s3OriginSource: {
            s3BucketSource: bucket,
            originAccessIdentity: new OriginAccessIdentity(this, 'cloudfront-oai'),
          },
          behaviors: [
            {
              isDefaultBehavior: true,
              allowedMethods: CloudFrontAllowedMethods.ALL,
              lambdaFunctionAssociations: [
                {
                  eventType: LambdaEdgeEventType.VIEWER_REQUEST,
                  lambdaFunction: graphqlVersion,
                },
              ],
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}
```

Provision CloudFront CDN taking S3 bucket as an origin and a function from the previous step as an interceptor of viewer requests.
