`UPDATE X WHERE X` in NoSQL is non-trivial task to do as opposed to other SQL databases. 

In SQL it's just one operation while on NoSQL you have to run `PUT` operation against each selected record.

That's not only time consuming task but it's also taking a lot of write throughput so might be expensive. 

Throttling can also prevent from some updates happening at all.

So, there are few challenges to solve:

1. Make sure all records were updated, no throttling rejections
2. Make sure it was cost effective when using Autoscaling - do not provision enormous capacity - buffer updates, keep it reasonable
3. Keep track of the progress and be notified when it ends
