Cold Starts, even longer cold starts when launched in VPC, SQL connections limit and complexity. These were the most mentioned problems of the Serverless throughout 2019. Luckily, Amazon hears us the community and as a part of re:Invent they've proposed a solution to the most of these problems. Here's a list of them. Future for Serverless workloads looks really promising in 2020!
