The [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk) is one of the newest tools from AWS Labs and I feel like it's not getting enough attention. Why? Let's start with quick quote which explains this tool:

> The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. The CDK integrates fully with AWS services and offers a higher level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively. Using the CDKâ€™s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic. 

This definition gives us a few key characteristics:

1. It's using CloudFormation under the hood, just like [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless)
2. It's "imperative" unlike CloudFormation or Terraform which are declarative
3. Offers high level abstractions to make development easier
4. It's defined using code instead of YAML or JSON
