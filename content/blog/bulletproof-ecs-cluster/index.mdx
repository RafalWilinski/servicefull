# Host in private, expose as via ALB/ELB

As you would like to have your nodes to be accessed only via internet-facing load balancer, you should make sure that your containers are not accessible directly.

# Use Spot Instances

# Use Parameter Store for environment variables

# Update ECS Agent on instances start

# Scale based on reservations, not usage

# Adjust grace period and cooldowns

# Run in multi-AZ

# Use Target Track Scaling instead of Step Scaling

# Or maybe even try custom scaling strategy with Events

# Use IaaC

# Configure blue-green deployment

# Make sure you have enough resources to deploy
